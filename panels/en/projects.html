        <h1>ArcticFlower</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Final project for the Computer and Information Technology Engineering graduate degree. This is the culmination of years of learning and experience in the field of engineering. This project uses concepts of web development, data mining, databases, algorithms and data structures, programming paradigms, software engineering, cibersecurity, disruptive technologies, and much more.</p>
    <p>This project seeks to fill a gap between the scientifid field dedicated to studying the enviroment, and in particular, the extinction crisis, with the general public. In such an inter-connected and globalised world, not only real information is propagated easier, fake news do too. And when it comes to the climate, being educated and acting is now a necessity, and doing the research and understanding the science behind the man-made issues that plague our enviroment, is something the average user doesn't have the time and/or ability to do.</p>
    <p>ArcticFlower is an interactive web application which displays the original habitat of critically endangered, extinct in the wild, or completely extinct species from around the planet on a globe. This, paired with gamification techniques such as levels, missions, daily quests and much more, provide the user with a captivating yet educational way of understanding the impact of the extinction crisis we are facing, to then finally guide the user towards action, by teaching enviromentally friendly practices and inciting a more hands-on approach by donating and joining different global NGOs dedicated to the cause.</p>
    <p>Technically, this project uses Node.js with Angular, MongoDB and many front and back-end libraries, with smart and efficient connection to different NGO APIs for scientifically accurate and up-to-date information on each species, such as IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources), GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) and many more.</p>

        <h1>Contribution to Retro Music Player</h1>
    </div>
    <p>One of the great satisfactions of programming is being able to identify a problem, no matter how small, and then develop a solution. As a cyclist, I always found that managing playlists while riding was a challenge with music players, especially with apps that require multiple taps to add a song to the queue.</p>
    <p>Inspired by Spotify's gesture-based functionality, I decided to implement a similar solution for my favorite music player, Retro Music Player, after discovering that it is an open-source project.</p>
    <p>This experience, which was my first foray into Android Studio and Kotlin, not only allowed me to add a key convenience feature (swipe to add to queue), but it also served as a powerful reminder of the importance of continuous learning, contributing to ongoing projects, and giving back to the open-source community.</p>
    <p>While it may not be perfect, this small project is an important step in continuing to explore new technologies and disciplines within computer science.</p>
    <p>Many thanks to the amazing community of contributors to the original Retro Player app, available on <a href="https://github.com/RetroMusicPlayer/RetroMusicPlayer">it's original repository.</a></p>
    <p>This implementation includes a toggle switch in the settings menu to disable gestures, as well as full integration with the application's views (folders, playlists, albums, artists, etc.) and the existing playback queue system.</p>
    <p>And of course, the preview version with the "Queue gestures" feature is available on GitHub.</p>

    <h2>Data Mining II (Python)</h2>
    <p>Second evaluated project for the <b>Data Mining</b> subject. In addition, it was one of the competing projects for the <b>Data Science Olympics</b> at UNAB. Generally speaking, simple and multiple linear regression models were required to predict the fuel efficiency of a car based on various characteristics, such as car weight, number of cylinders, horsepower and others.
    <br><br>
    Then, we had to use Decision Trees to predict the approval of a loan application, using historical data such as the applicant's income, loan amount, credit history, among others.
    <br><br>
    Finally, we were required to use neural networks to predict the possibility of a patient suffering from a heart disease based on various variables, such as cholesterol levels, electrocardiological examination results, blood sugar levels, among others.
    <br><br>
    To conclude, an analysis was carried out on the models generated and a reflection on the knowledge acquired in the activity.</p>
