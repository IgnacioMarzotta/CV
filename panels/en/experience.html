            <h4>IT services consultancy specialized in the implementation of Web3 technologies.</h4>
            <p class="txt">In this <b>engineering internship</b>, the following tasks were performed:</p>
            <p class="txt">Participation in project development using agile methodologies, with a focus on the creation and optimization of scalable systems. In the back-end area, databases were implemented and optimized, ensuring an efficient and secure structure. CRUD systems for information management were developed and maintained, in addition to modernizing services to improve platform performance and stability. Work was also done on the integration of Web3 technologies, enabling interaction with the blockchain and the execution of decentralized transactions, ensuring data integrity through validations and security mechanisms.</p>
            <p class="txt">In front-end development, dynamic and responsive interfaces were implemented, aligned with usability and user experience principles. Smart contracts were integrated to connect the application to the blockchain, ensuring fluid communication between the system and decentralized services, including staking and token purchasing systems.</p>
            <p class="txt">One of the main features was to cement the foundations of the multi-login system, restructuring some pre-existing user systems and adding guest and Web2 users to the existing Web3 ones. This involved implementing various techniques, such as the EIP-6963 provider discovery protocol, and much more.</p>
            <p class="txt">This also included unit and integration testing to ensure system stability, as well as bug resolution in various development and production environments. Conflict analysis and resolution were performed in continuous integration processes, optimizing deployment and maintenance workflows in production.</p>
            <p class="txt">In a collaborative environment, we worked in close coordination with multidisciplinary teams, participating in planning and monitoring meetings using agile methodologies. Processes and workflows were documented, facilitating project scalability and evolution. We also worked to optimize performance, improving user interaction through the implementation of filters, pagination, and advanced search systems.</p>
