        <h2>A few words about me</h2>
        <p>Since I was little, I have always found deep interest in the field of computers and programming. Coming from a background of playing around with beginner tools such as Wix and Construct2, learning how to code opened my mind to endless possibilities and a new way to appreciate the world and technology around me, giving me a new way to free my imagination.</p>

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>I fully believe in the idea of selflessness and caring for each other without expecting anything in return.</p>
        <div class="philosophy_content">
            <p>I believe that happiness and joy comes from not only succeeding, but helping those around you achieve their goals. Sometimes even the smallest of actions can drastically change someone else, and doing something positive for them without expecting anything in return is, in my opinion, one of the most pure acts of humanity. <br> My most outstanding moral values:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Disciplined</li>
                <li>Open-minded</li>
                <li>Honest</li>
                <li>Respectful</li>
                <li>Fast learner</li>
                <li>Creative</li>
