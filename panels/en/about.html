    <h2>A few words about me</h2>
    <p>Ever since I was litte, I've had a deep interest in the field of computers and programming. From playing around with tools like Wix and Construct 2, coding helped me free my imagination and bring my ideas to life, giving me new tools to see the world and technology through a new lens.</p>

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>I'm a firm believer in the idea of selfless empathy, the concept of helping someone else without expecting anything in return.</p>
    <div class="">
        <p>I believe that happiness and accomplishment comes from not only beign successful, but also helping those around you be happy and achieve their goals. And sometimes it's those little actions the ones that can change a person for the better, and doing something positive for someone else is, in my opinion, one of the most pure acts of humanity.<br> My most important moral values:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Discipline</li>
            <li>Open minded</li>
            <li>Honesty</li>
            <li>Respect</li>
            <li>Learning and adapting quickly</li>
            <li>Creativity</li>
        </ul>
