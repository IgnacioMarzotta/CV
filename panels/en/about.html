    <h2>A brief history about me</h2>
    <p>My interest in technology began at a young age: first creating simple websites on Wix or games in Construct 2, and eventually discovering that programming was a powerful tool for building ideas from scratch. That initial curiosity transformed into a vocation, leading me to full-stack development, Web3, and software engineering applied to real-world problems.</p>
